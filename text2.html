        <h2>Journey to Navgurukul</h2>
        <small>November, 2021</small>
        <P>I was watching one of my fevorite movie Iron man, in that i 
            found a very interesting program name JARVIS on that 
            moment i got curious about that and i start searching 
            about the programming languagesAfter i dicided to be a programmer i 
            searched many of training centres but i could'nt find any profitable in 
            that. After a while i got know about Navgurukul through its youtube chennel. 
            Now i am the student of Navgurukul and i am studing full stack developer.
            When i came here i saw manythings in navgurukul.Here i can here learn
            many things not only the coding but i also learn self dependend skill
            and learn how to cook food becouse here we have to cook for self only.
            In navgurukul i have holiday on the day of wednesday on that day we 
            used go out from the navgurukul campus used to visit many places like 
            cricket stadium like fort ,forest and river.


              </P>
        <h2>Learning python</h2>
        <p>At starting in Navgurukul i have to learn python first and then move on for
            JavaScript. Why python first? becouse python is a frindly language for 
            beginner and its syntax are very similer to english language so a 
            beginner can easily get know about the python. 
        </p>
        <h2>Learning JavaScript.</h2>
        <p>When at the end of the python learning i got selected for the ZeroLevel of neog camp.
            In that i had learned many things about JavaScript. In neog i got know how REACT will
            work , i learn about vanilla JS , i learn about github and i learn about HTML & CSS </p>
